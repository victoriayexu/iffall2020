            Fenty Beauty is most famous for launching with 40 different
            foundation shades. There is a plethora of other products the brand
            is well-known for, as well.

          Fenty Beauty's first products went on sale on September 8, 2017. The
          launch coincided with New York Fashion Week, where Rihanna also had a
          runway show for her collaboration with Puma. Promotion was so
          extensive, The New York Times wrote, "one might be forgiven for
          thinking it's actually Rihanna New York Fashion Week." In the US, the
          line launched in Sephora stores, on the Sephora website, and on Fenty
          Beauty's website. In the UK, Fenty Beauty was initially exclusive to
          Harvey Nichols department stores, until it was announced in May 2019
          the line would also become available in the high street chemist Boots
          UK. Fenty Beauty is available online or in store in over 15 countries.
          Fenty Beauty arrived in Saudi Arabia, seen as a potentially lucrative
          market for the brand, with cosmetic sales in the country at an
          all-time high.

          Fenty Beauty products have drawn international praise for the range of
          shades offered, in particular for including darker shades among the
          first 40, then 50 different colors for its Pro Filt'R foundation,
          addressing a long-criticized gap in cosmetic industry offerings for
          black women and other women of color. Subsequent launches of new
          products and new lines have been criticized for the failure to live up
          to the new standard set by Fenty Beauty, for instance Kim Kardashian
          West's line KKW Beauty, Tarte's Shape Tape Foundation, and Benefit's
          Hello Happy foundation. The line's Stunna Lip Paint, a red lipstick
          launched November 23, 2017 (Thanksgiving, just ahead of Black Friday
          Sales), also drew broad enthusiasm. Reviewing the product at BuzzFeed
          News, Leticia Miranda noted the history of controversy around red
          lipstick, particularly for women of color, saying the context made the
          choice of color for Stunna "assertive, confrontational, unapologetic".
          Since the release of the original red Stunna Lip Paint, Fenty Beauty
          has also released four more lip paints in baby pink, peach nude,
          chocolate brown, and black.

            On March 23, 2018, the line launched a limited-edition highlighter
            called Dirty Thirty for Rihanna's 30th birthday; it is the line's
            popular Killawatt Freestyle Highlighter in Trophy Wife shade
            (metallic gold), packaged with XXX (the Roman numerals for 30)
            instead of the brand's FB logo.
