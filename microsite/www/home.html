            Before she was BadGalRiRi: music, fashion and beauty icon, Robyn
            Rihanna Fenty was a little girl in Barbados transfixed by her
            mother’s lipstick. The first time she experienced makeup for
            herself, she never looked back. Makeup became her weapon of choice
            for self-expression—a way to radiate her ever-changing mood—and it
            powered a fearless take on beauty that helped her become the
            boundary-breaking icon she is today. Rihanna was inspired to create
            Fenty Beauty after years of experimenting with the best-of-the-best
            in beauty—and still seeing a void in the industry for products that
            performed across all skin types and tones. She launched a makeup
            line “so that people everywhere would be included,” focusing on a
            wide range of traditionally hard-to-match skin tones, creating
            formulas that work for all skin types, and pinpointing universal
            shades. Fenty Beauty products are designed to feel lightweight, even
            as they deliver buildable coverage that effortlessly layers, to
            ultimately “make skin look like skin.”

            Starting with Fenty Beauty foundation, face primer and Gloss Bomb,
            she launched a makeup line “so that people everywhere would be
            included,” focusing on a wide range of traditionally hard-to-match
            skin tones, creating formulas that work for all skin types, and
            pinpointing universal shades. From Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Foundation
            & Hydrating Foundation that changed the game with 50 inclusive
            shades, to the fan-fave concealer and setting powder, to the wide
            shade range of cream blush. Fenty Beauty products are designed to
            feel lightweight and love to be layered. Most importantly, Rihanna
            creates makeup to inspire: “Makeup is there for you to have fun
            with,” she says. “It should never feel like pressure. It should
            never feel like a uniform. Feel free to take chances, and take
            risks, and dare to do something new or different.”
