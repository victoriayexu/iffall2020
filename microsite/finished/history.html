            Rihanna launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 when she was 29 years old.
            Previously she had collaborated with MAC Cosmetics, as well as
            released 10 fragrances via Parlux Ltd, but Fenty Beauty was her
            first solo cosmetics brand. She developed the line with luxury
            conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessey (LVMH), signing a deal in
            2016 to produce Fenty Beauty through LVMH's Kendo division. Kendo
            Holdings, Inc, is an "incubator" company that manufactures cosmetics
            as white-label products for sale through cosmetics retailer Sephora,
            another LVMH subsidiary, as well as other outlets.[6] Women's Wear
            Daily reported that LVMH may have paid $10 million (USD) for the
            agreement, which followed on Kendo deals to produce Marc Jacobs
            Beauty and Kat Von D Beauty lines.

            Rihanna, who is from Barbados, created Fenty Beauty to provide for
            the inclusion of all skin tones in cosmetics offerings, including
            extensive shade offerings for people with deeper skin tones.

          Fenty Beauty's first products went on sale on September 8, 2017. The
          launch coincided with New York Fashion Week, where Rihanna also had a
          runway show for her collaboration with Puma. Promotion was so
          extensive, The New York Times wrote, "one might be forgiven for
          thinking it's actually Rihanna New York Fashion Week." In the US, the
          line launched in Sephora stores, on the Sephora website, and on Fenty
          Beauty's website. In the UK, Fenty Beauty was initially exclusive to
          Harvey Nichols department stores, until it was announced in May 2019
          the line would also become available in the high street chemist Boots
          UK. Fenty Beauty is available online or in store in over 15 countries.
          Fenty Beauty arrived in Saudi Arabia, seen as a potentially lucrative
          market for the brand, with cosmetic sales in the country at an
          all-time high.

          Fenty Beauty products have drawn international praise for the range of
          shades offered, in particular for including darker shades among the
          first 40, then 50 different colors for its Pro Filt'R foundation,
          addressing a long-criticized gap in cosmetic industry offerings for
          black women and other women of color. Subsequent launches of new
          products and new lines have been criticized for the failure to live up
          to the new standard set by Fenty Beauty, for instance Kim Kardashian
          West's line KKW Beauty, Tarte's Shape Tape Foundation, and Benefit's
          Hello Happy foundation. The line's Stunna Lip Paint, a red lipstick
          launched November 23, 2017 (Thanksgiving, just ahead of Black Friday
          Sales), also drew broad enthusiasm. Reviewing the product at BuzzFeed
          News, Leticia Miranda noted the history of controversy around red
          lipstick, particularly for women of color, saying the context made the
          choice of color for Stunna "assertive, confrontational, unapologetic".
          Since the release of the original red Stunna Lip Paint, Fenty Beauty
          has also released four more lip paints in baby pink, peach nude,
          chocolate brown, and black.

                On March 23, 2018, the line launched a limited-edition
                highlighter called Dirty Thirty for Rihanna's 30th birthday; it
                is the line's popular Killawatt Freestyle Highlighter in Trophy
                Wife shade (metallic gold), packaged with XXX (the Roman
                numerals for 30) instead of the brand's FB logo.

                On April 6, 2018, Fenty Beauty released three products in its
                Beach, Please collection. Body Lava, Fenty Beauty's first body
                product, is a liquid that can be buffed into any part of the
                body for illumination and is available in either a peach tone
                called Who Needs Clothes or a golden one, Brown Sugar. To apply
                the Body Lava, the Kabuki Brush is available for purchase
                separately. Meanwhile, the Fairy Bomb Glittering Pom Pom is both
                applicator and product: the pom pom is packed with rose gold
                glitter designed to fit all skin tones. The pom pom also has a
                vanilla-coconut scent.
