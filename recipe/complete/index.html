          <span>This recipe</span> was one I improvised one night when I had to
          help my friend use up some chicken breast. We wanted something with
          minimal marinating and were keen on avoiding the oven, as it was
          getting late. We were also craving Korean flavors. So, after I mixed
          up a glazey gochujang sauce, we tested searing the chicken breast as
          one piece versus cutting it into smaller chunks. Searing led to a
          pretty, caramelized exterior, but required monitoring the doneness and
          letting the meat rest before cutting, and we were missing seasoning on
          the cut sides. Stir-frying/sautéing strips lead to a saucy glaze and
          more tender, evenly-cooked chicken, which is now my preferred method.
          Nowadays, whenever I’m in a pinch, this is a recipe I know I can fall
          back on; the sauce proportions is mostly eyeballed and easily scaled
          up or down, and the cook time is quick and fool-proof from burning and
          dryness.

          <ul>
            <li>2 lbs (about 3 large) boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>4 tbsp gochujang</li>
            <li>3 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp honey</li>

            <li>Splash of sesame oil (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oil of choice (I use olive or avocado)</li>
            <li>1 large scallion, chopped</li>
            <li>Cilantro, chopped (garnish)</li>

          <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Butterfly the chicken breast so that the breast opens to a heart
              shape. Continue cutting through the center to result in two
              mirrored pieces. Then, cut against the grain, widthwise, to result
              in short (not long) strips. Longer strips can be cut in half to
              make the sizes more uniform. Set aside in a bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make the sauce/marinade by combining the gochujang, oyster sauce,
              honey, soy sauce, and optional sesame oil. The measurements are
              rather approximate; start with the listed proportion and adjust
              according to taste. Mix well until uniform and glossy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spoon about 2/3s of the sauce into the bowl of cut chicken and
              massage it in to ensure even coating. Set aside for about 10
              minutes (but the time it takes to slowly heat up the pan should be
              enough for the chicken to marinate a bit).
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the oil to a nonstick pan and let it warm up to medium high
              heat. Add a handful of the scallions and fry them until slightly
              browned.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pour in the chicken and the marinating sauce and spread out to
              ensure each piece has contact with the pan. Let sear until
              browned, then give all pieces a rough toss. Repeat so that most
              sides are browned.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lower heat to medium/medium-low to reduce the sauce and make sure
              the interiors are fully cooked. Continue cooking, stirring
              occasionally, until sauce reaches desired viscosity. You may mix
              in your reserved sauce with the cooked chicken now to coat and
              boost the flavor if you feel it’s necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plate the chicken and garnish with cilantro and remaining
              scallions.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
