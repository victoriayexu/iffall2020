    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

        My name is Victoria Xu; I'm a Communication Design major (minors in
        Biology and HCI) and I'm a junior.

      <li>
        I'm from Westchester County, NY, but I have moved around a quite a bit.
        I am taking this class as part of the Communication Design major
        requirements, but I am also excited to learn more about CSS. Especially
        with the explosion of online interactions thanks to the pandemic, design
        for digital platforms have become ever more important.

        I have taken one or two HTML workshops as a child and experimented with
        HTML/CSS for my player profile on an online game quite a few years back,
        as well. Apart from those familiarities, I haven't used HTML/CSS/JS
        extensively before.

        Through this class, I hope to learn more about the process behind
        styling webpages so I can better design projects for the screen with the
        developer in mind, as well as be able to comprehend code when presented
        with it.

        Digital interfaces have a lot more dynamism in terms of sizes,
        animations, and interactivity. Thus, there will no doubt be differences
        between designing for the screen and for paper. Things I feel I would
        have to keep in mind would include responsive design (to changing screen
        sizes and mobile interfaces) and accessability (contrast,
        colorblindness, etc.). Additionally, there are many givens to physical
        products like magazines that must be actively implemented in digital
        design, such as subsections and nagivation, due to the breadth of ways
        one can interact on a digital platform.

      <li>
        The
        <a href="https://collaboratorio.fi/en/frontpage/">Collaborolorio</a> is
        an architecture studio whose site whose design I find to be visually
        pleasing and effective. The use of a large, minimalist sans-serif
        typeface throughout reinforces its branding of modern, clean, Nordic
        design. Custom cursors are often a risky addition to a web page as they
        can potentially be distracting, but the dot-shaped cursor on this site
        moves smoothly, and the way it inverts the color of whatever it hovers
        over is a unique interaction. Staggering the thumbnails of the studios
        projects also provides interest as the viewer scrolls down, without
        compromising readability.

      <li>
        The website for <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/">IKEA</a> is one I
        find to exemplify good communication. There is a unified visual language
        throughout, consisting of rounded sans-serif type and ample negative
        space, along with rounded icons to match.. The menu opens off to the
        side, giving the view options to browse by room or by product. The stark
        contrast between the scale and the weight of the type in this menu makes
        the different menu categories clear: shopping, articles/inspiration, and
        account/ordering.

      <li>
        <a href="https://million-devs.netlify.com/">Netlify's Million Devs</a>
        celebration page is a site that combines a strong visual language and
        engagine interactions to result in a site that works well holistically.
        On the top left, there is the option to turn animations off, which is a
        thoughtful feature regarding accessability and empathy for users who
        potentially have slow internet connections that would hinder the website
        experience.The animations are smooth and add visual interest without
        distracting from the information. The incorporation of the illustration
        path with the text boxes' fade-in transitions prompt the viewer to
        continue scrolling down. Finally, links open in a new tab to prevent
        viewers from losing their place in scrolling.
